                Source Filmmaker (SFM) is a animating software
                created and distributed by Valve, a large 
                coporation that is known for creating Steam
                and Half-Life. I have made a few amount of decent 
                animations that have gotten better each time I used it.
                The only actual animation I have put out was an exageration 
                of how bad the state of the game Team Fortress 2 is in.

                Team Fortress 2 is a class based team game where
                9 classes fight against each other to reach a goal.
                I have made several videos and streams of this game 
                where me and my friends would do some of the stupidest 
                things in the game and get away with it. I have put almost 
                1k hours into the game and have made several posters
                about the game.

                The Unnofficial Salmon Run Data Page
            is a side project that I have been working on for months now.
            The website was created for my love of the game, Splatoon 3, and 
            I wanted to do something that was big enough for my scope but also 
            accesible for anyone who is interested in the game like I am.
